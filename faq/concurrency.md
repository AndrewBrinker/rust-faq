Can I use static values across threads without an <code>unsafe</code> block?

Mutation is safe if it's synchronized. Mutating a static [`Mutex`][Mutex] (lazily initialized via the [lazy-static](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static/) crate) does not require an `unsafe` block, nor does mutating a static [`AtomicUsize`][AtomicUsize] (which can be initialized without lazy_static).

More generally, if a type implements [`Sync`][Sync] and does not implement [`Drop`][Drop], it [can be used in a `static`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/const-and-static.html#static).
