Can I write a macro to generate identifiers?
</a></h3>

Not currently. Rust macros are ["hygienic macros"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro), which intentionally avoid capturing or creating identifiers that may cause unexpected collisions with other identifiers. Their capabilities are significantly different than the style of macros commonly associated with the C preprocessor. Macro invocations can only appear in places where they are explicitly supported: items, method declarations, statements, expressions, and patterns. Here, "method declarations" means a blank space where a method can be put. They can't be used to complete a partial method declaration. By the same logic, they can't be used to complete a partial variable declaration.
