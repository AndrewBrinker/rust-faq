<p class="faq-intro">
This page exists to answer common questions about the Rust programming language. It is not a complete guide to the language, nor is it a tool for teaching the language. It is a reference to answer oft-repeated questions people in the Rust community encounter, and to clarify the reasoning behind some of Rust's design decisions.
