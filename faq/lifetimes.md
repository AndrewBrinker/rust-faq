Why lifetimes?
</a></h3>

Lifetimes are Rust's answer to the question of memory safety. They allow Rust to ensure memory safety without the performance costs of garbage collection. They are based on a variety of academic work, which can be found in the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/bibliography.html#type-system).

Why is the lifetime syntax the way it is?
</a></h3>

The `'a` syntax comes from the ML family of programming languages, where `'a` is used to indicate a generic type parameter. For Rust, the syntax had to be something that was unambiguous, noticeable, and fit nicely in a type declaration right alongside traits and references. Alternative syntaxes have been discussed, but no alternative syntax has been demonstrated to be clearly better.

How do I return a borrow to something I created from a function?
</a></h3>

You need to ensure that the borrowed item will outlive the function. This can be done by binding the output lifetime to some input lifetime like so:

```rust
type Pool = TypedArena<Thing>;

// (the lifetime below is only written explicitly for
// expository purposes; it can be omitted via the
// elision rules described in a later FAQ entry)
fn create_borrowed<'a>(pool: &'a Pool,
                       x: i32,
                       y: i32) -> &'a Thing {
    pool.alloc(Thing { x: x, y: y })
}
```

An alternative is to eliminate the references entirely by returning an owning type like [`String`][String]:

```rust
fn happy_birthday(name: &str, age: i64) -> String {
    format!("Hello {}! You're {} years old!", name, age)
}
```

This approach is simpler, but often results in unnecessary allocations.

<h3><a href="#when-are-lifetimes-required-to-be-explicit" name="when-are-lifetimes-required-to-be-explicit">
Why do some references have lifetimes, like <code>&amp;'a T</code>, and some do not, like <code>&amp;T</code>?
</a></h3>

In fact, *all* reference types have a lifetime, but most of the time you do not have to write
it explicitly. The rules are as follows:

1. Within a function body, you never have to write a lifetime explicitly; the correct value
   should always be inferred.
2. Within a function *signature* (for example, in the types of its
   arguments, or its return type), you *may* have to write a lifetime
   explicitly. Lifetimes there use a simple defaulting scheme called
   ["lifetime elision"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/lifetimes.html#lifetime-elision),
   which consists of the following three rules:
  - Each elided lifetime in a functionâ€™s arguments becomes a distinct lifetime parameter.
  - If there is exactly one input lifetime, elided or not, that
    lifetime is assigned to all elided lifetimes in the return values
    of that function.
  - If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one of them is &self
    or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided
    output lifetimes.
3. Finally, in a `struct` or `enum` definition, all lifetimes must be explicitly declared.

If these rules result in compilation errors, the Rust compiler will provide an error message indicating the error caused, and suggesting a potential solution based on which step of the inference process caused the error.

How can Rust guarantee "no null pointers" and "no dangling pointers"?
</a></h3>

The only way to construct a value of type `&Foo` or `&mut Foo` is to specify an existing value of type `Foo` that the reference points to. The reference "borrows" the original value for a given region of code (the lifetime of the reference), and the value being borrowed from cannot be moved or destroyed for the duration of the borrow.

How do I express the absence of a value without <code>null</code>?
</a></h3>

You can do that with the [`Option`][Option] type, which can either be `Some(T)` or `None`. `Some(T)` indicates that a value of type `T` is contained within, while `None` indicates the absence of a value.
